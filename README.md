# VideoViewer

VideoViewer is a test repo designed to present questions for a job interview.
The system let a user view 20 videos and then pays the user 1$ for watching all of them.
The server side is implemented in php/mysql and client side in HTML/JS and also in Android as a native app.

Definitions:
* The VideoViewer server endpoint is at: http://videoviewer.com/ws.php

Questions:
1. Please write a simple JS library to interact with the php server side. JS flavor can be either JQuery or Vanilla (no JS framework). Bootstrap is optional. No design is needed - simple strings with current state are recommended, e.g: "Session was created successfully! Now showing video 1 out of 20".
