## Questions:
1. The server side php file has some errors - please fix them. All methods in the VideoViewerV1 interface must be exposed and invokable by a client. The implementation in the server file MUST NOT trigger any error.
2. Please write a **simple** JS library to interact with the php server. JS flavor can be either JQuery or Vanilla (no JS framework). Bootstrap is optional. No design is needed - simple strings with current state are recommended, e.g: "Session was created successfully! Now showing video 1 out of 20". The VideoViewer client-server protocol for interaction is dictated by the VideoViewerV1 interface.
3. Please write a **simple** Android Java app with minimal design. The first step in the client-server interaction (fetching HTML) is not necessary. The video should be played inside the app. The VideoViewer client-server protocol for interaction is dictated by the VideoViewerV1 interface.
4. Please write a **simple** iOS Objective-C app with minimal design. The first step in the client-server interaction (fetching HTML) is not necessary. The video should be played inside the app. The VideoViewer client-server protocol for interaction is dictated by the VideoViewerV1 interface.

Please answer question 3 OR question 4.
